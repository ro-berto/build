"""Script to calculate the latest fitting git commit hash for a patch.

A commit fits if the hashes of all base files from the patch are equal to
the hashes of the respective files from the commit. As multiple such commits
might exist, this returns the latest.

This looks back for a maximum of 1000 commits. Doesn't support windows.

Expects three arguments:
1) a file containing the raw patch,
2) folder with the checkout,
3) a file to write the result hash to.
