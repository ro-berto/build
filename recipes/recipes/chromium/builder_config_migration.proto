// An operation to compute builder groupings for a project
//
// The groupings operation will compute the groupings for a LUCI project and
// then output a JSON file containing the groupings. A grouping is all of the
// builders that must have their config migrated src-side together, which is all
// builders that are related through either a triggering relationship or a
// mirroring relationship.
//
// The format of the groupings JSON is a dict where the keys are the stringified
// form of a chromium.BuilderId and the values are a list of the stringified
// forms of a chromium.BuilderId for all of the builders that are part of the
// same grouping. The stringified form of a chromium.BuilderId is
// `<builder-group>:<builder>`.

  // more specific matches should appear later in the list. If a builder group
  // does not match any entries, it will be excluded from the output.
