"""Recipe to enforce that testing occurs for CLs that require testing.

This recipe fails for any CL that has the Requires-Testing footer set in
the CL description. A builder running this recipe can be set up to only
run in a fallback CQ group. The builder will only run for branches which
an actual CQ is not running, so automated CLs that are created by
rollers that set the Requires-Testing footer won't be able to land if
the branch has not been configured.
