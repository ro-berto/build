  // Maps LUCI projects declared in recipe BotSpecs to the LUCI project to use
  // when triggering builders.
  //
  // For branch CI support using separate projects for milestones, there will be
  // builders in different projects that use the same BotSpec instance. The
  // BotSpec indicates the LUCI project associated with the builder. The
  // recipe-declared project for a builder will only be accurate for the main
  // version of the builder, not the branched versions of the builder. This
  // property corrects the inaccuracy by mapping the project on a BotSpec to the
  // actual project to use.
  //
  // Example:
  //   (builder_group='chromium.linux', buildername='Linux Tests') sets its
  //   parent to (builder_group='chromium.linux', buildername='Linux Builder').
  //   When 'Linux Builder' runs, it triggers 'Linux Tests'. The BotSpec for
  //   'Linux Tests' has 'chromium' as the value of its luci_project attribute,
  //   so by default it triggers the 'Linux Tests' job in project 'chromium'.
  //   If the properties maps 'chromium' to 'chromium-m86', then instead the
  //   'Linux Tests' job in project 'chromium-m86' will be triggered.
