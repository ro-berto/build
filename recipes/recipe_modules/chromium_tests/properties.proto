  // Maps a checkout-relative path to the actual revision to check out for the
  // repo that gets checked out to that path. The revision information is
  // provided by the JSON output of bot_update based on which revisions are
  // specified by the gitiles input and/or the gclient config, not the contents
  // of the DEPS file.
  //
  // Example:
  //   'GPU FYI Linux Builder' gets the revision for src from the gitiles input
  //   and floats src/third_party/angle to 'HEAD'. It ends up checking out
  //   revisions X and Y respectively. To ensure the testers check out the same
  //   revisions, it adds the entries 'src': X and 'src/third_party/angle': Y.
  //   The tester will override the gclient config for those paths to get the
  //   same version.
