  This type provides the means of specifying all of the input values for a

  drawbacks:
    * Susceptible to typos for key names
    * Lack of validation at definition time
    * Poor discoverability of available fields
    * Default values for fields are specified at the point(s) of access

  This type address the first 2 points. The 3rd point is also addressed with the
  caveat that recipes/recipe modules that add their own information to the spec
  require a type containing fields with the additional information. To remain
  backwards compatible with existing code, the 4th point is not addressed yet.

  Backwards compatibility:
  Until callers have switched over to accessing the fields directly, a
  BuilderSpec acts as a mapping with an item for each field whose value is not
  None, with the name of the field as the key.
