"""Module for working with builder groups.

A builder group is a semi-arbitrary grouping. Some defaults are set
based on the builder group but otherwise there is no relationship in the
code between builders in the same group. The grouping exists as an
artifact of the buildbot CI system but is used heavily within the code
as part of the identifier for a builder. Until such time as it can be
removed, this provides an interface for determining a grouping.

Grouping can be retrieved for the following builders:
* current - The currently running builder.
* parent - The builder that triggered the currently running builder.
* target - The builder being targeted by the currently running builder.
    This is used by findit, where a single builder performs bisection
    for other builders by building using the target builder's
    configuration.
