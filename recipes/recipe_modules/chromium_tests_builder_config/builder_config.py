  BuilderConfig provides access to information defined entirely in

  the same for all builds of a given builder.

  BuilderConfig wraps multiple builder specs and provides the means for
  getting values in a manner that ensures they are compatible between
  all of the wrapped specs. BuilderConfig overrides attribute access so
  that attempting to access any attribute that is defined on the specs
  returns the value on the specs, raising an exception if the value is
  inconsistent between the specs. The builders that have their specs
  wrapped are returned by `builder_ids`.

  In addition to wrapping the BuilderSpecs for some builders, it can
  also record other builders as being in scope for testing (e.g. a
  tester triggered by a builder whose spec is wrapped). The builders
  that are in scope for testing will not have their specs wrapped, but
  will have their source side spec files included when accessing
  `source_side_spec_files`.
