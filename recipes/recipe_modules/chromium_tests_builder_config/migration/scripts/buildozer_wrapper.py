The format of the input json file is a list of dicts with the following keys
(all required):

* builder_group - A string with the builder group of the builder.
* builder - A string with the name of the builder.
* edits - A dict where the keys are the names of the arguments to set in the
  builder definition and the corresponding values are the value for that
  argument. There should be no unescaped whitespace in the value except for
  space characters within string values.

buildozer must be installed on the system.
buildozer can be installed with the following command:

go install github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/buildozer@latest
