class TriggerScript(object):
  """A type describing a custom script for triggering swarming tasks.

  Attributes:
    * script: A path to a script to call which will use custom logic to
      trigger appropriate swarming jobs, using swarming.py. Required.
    * args: An optional list of additional arguments to pass to the
      script.

  The script will receive the exact same arguments that are normally
  passed to calls to `swarming.py trigger`, along with any arguments
  provided in the `args` entry.

  The script is required to output a json file to the location provided
  by the `--dump-json` argument. This json file should describe the
  swarming tasks it launched, as well as some information about the
  request, which is used when swarming collects the tasks.

  If the script launches multiple swarming shards, it needs to pass the
  appropriate environment variables to each shard (this is normally done
  by `swarming.py trigger`). Specifically, each shard should receive
  GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`, which is its shard index, and
  `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS`, which is the total number of shards. This can be
  done by passing `--env GTEST_SHARD_INDEX [NUM]` and `--env
  GTEST_SHARD_SHARDS [NUM]` when calling `swarming.py trigger`.

    * args: An optional list of additional arguments to pass to the

  * The arguments in the `args` attribute.
