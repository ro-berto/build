  """Combines two xml jacoco report files into one.

  Expected input is two jacoco coverage report xml files.
  The report is composed of a tree of nodes, the root node is the "report" node
  which contains counters and packages.
  -The package nodes contain class nodes, sourcefile nodes, and counters.
  -The class nodes contain the class's name, method nodes, and counters
  -The sourcefile nodes contain the file name, line nodes, and counters
  -The method nodes contain the method's name and counters.
  -The line nodes contain 4 attributes,
    nr=line number corresponding to the physical line in the sourcefile.
    mi=missed instructions for the line
    ci=covered instructiosn for the line
    mb=missed branch for the line
    cb=covered branch for the line

  The counters contain an instruction type as found in JAVA_COVERAGE_METRICS
  and the total number of "covered" or "missed" items on that metric in that
  node. So a class node's counters contain the sum of counters in the methods.
  The package node's counters contain the sum total of the counters in the
  sourcefile nodes. The sourcefile nodes contain the sum total of the counters
  in the line node.

  The code walks down to each method in the main report and finds
  the matching method in the auxiliary report. It then chooses to use the
  coverage data from whichever node is higher. This is not perfect as main
  report can have 10 covered and 10 missed, and auxiliary can have 15 covered
  and 5 missed, so maybe it should be 20 covered and 0 missed if the coverage
  overlaps properly. If a method/class/package is in the auxiliary report and
  not in the main report, it adds it into the main_report.

  The code then walks down the sourcefiles and adds to the main report any
  lines that are in the auxiliary report and not already present. It then
  compares every line in the main report to the auxiliary report and chooses to
  use the line that has higher ci. It then calculates a new sum for the counters
  in sourcefile and packages and reports (not classes and methods).

  Args:
    combined_file_path: The write path of combined report.
    main_file_path: The location of the main coverage report.
    auxiliary_file_path: The location of the auxiliary coverage report.
