"""Recipe API for polymorphic builders.

Polymorphic builders are builders that are triggered on behalf of target
builders. The polymorphic builder will load the configuration of a
target builder (determined by properties set in the build request) and
execute operations using that configuration. Because the target builder
must be specified as part of the trigger, polymorphic builders can't be
run on a schedule/triggered via the scheduler, they must be triggered by
another builder or some service that sets the appropriate properties to
enable the polymorphic builder to load the correct configuration.

This module provides utilities for implementing both the triggerer and
the polymorphic builder:
* builders that trigger polymorphic builders:
  * get_target_properties
* Polymorphic builders:
  * target_builder_id
  * lookup_builder_config
