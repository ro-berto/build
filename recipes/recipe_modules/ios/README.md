# iOS recipe module

The recipe module is a module containing common functions for iOS recipes. This
doc assumes you've read the [docs] in [chromium/src] for details about how the
iOS bots work and that you know what [recipes] are.

[TOC]

## Public methods

### checkout

Checks out [chromium/src] including all DEPS with `target_os=ios`. If the
`clobber` property is set, any existing checkout will be removed first,
otherwise the checkout will be incremental (and thus faster). If there is
any patch to be applied from [rietveld] or [gerrit] then it will be applied
during this step.

### read\_build\_config

Reads the builder's own config from the [configs directory]. The configs dir
contains group-specific directories which contain builder-specific JSON files
containing the configuration. Typically a builder will only read its own config,
but the try bots on [tryserver.chromium.mac] read their configs from the
[chromium.mac] directory which ensures that try bots match main waterfall bots.

The [docs] explain the configs in more detail. You must call `checkout()` before
calling `read_build_config()`.

### build

Compiles Chromium for iOS according to the config. By default, uses [mb] to
generate the build files, but pass `use_mb=False` to use [gn] instead. Pass
`analyze=True` to enable use of the analyzer on a try bot. The analyzer
determines which configured `tests` and `additional_compile_targets` were
changed by an applied patch and compiles only those targets. If the `gn_args`
in the config specify `use_goma=True` then goma, the distributed build system
used by Chromium, will be enabled. Compilation is performed using ninja.

You must call `read_build_config()` before calling `build()`.

### upload

Uploads compiled artifacts based on the config. The artifacts must be in the
`out` directory, so this can be used to upload test suites or other files
generated by `build()`.

You must call `read_build_config()` before calling `upload()`.

### test\_swarming

Runs configured tests using [swarming]. Tests are triggered to run remotely on
the [swarming server] which enables them to run in parallel rather than serially
if run locally on the bot. If any tests were determined to be unaffected by
the analyzer during `build()` they will be skipped here, otherwise all tests
will run.

You must call `read_build_config()` before calling `test_swarming()`.

### Example

A sample recipe can be constructed using the public methods documented above:
```python
PYTHON_VERSION_COMPATIBILITY = "PY3"

DEPS = [
  'ios',
]

def RunSteps(api):
  api.ios.checkout()
  api.ios.read_build_config()
  api.ios.build()
  api.ios.upload()
  api.ios.test_swarming()
```
