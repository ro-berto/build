"""Common logic for interacting with the canonical test results format.

This is expected to be shared between multiple parts of the test_utils
module and exposed to other modules.

The canonical format is a dict of the form:

  {
    'valid': bool,
    # Can be any iterable.
    'failures': [
      'failed_test1',
      ...
    ],
    'total_tests_ran': int,
    'pass_fail_counts': {
      'test1': {
        'PASS_COUNT': int,
        'FAIL_COUNT': int,
      },
      ...
    },
    'findit_notrun': set(),
  }
"""

  All of the arguments below will be present in the returned dict, whether

    pass_fail_counts: A dictionary that maps test names to pass and fail counts,
