"""Common logic for interacting with the canonical test results format.

This is expected to be shared between multiple parts of the test_utils
module and exposed to other modules.

The canonical format is a dict of the form:

  {
    'valid': bool,
    # Can be any iterable.
    'failures': [
      'failed_test1',
      ...
    ],
    'total_tests_ran': int,
    'pass_fail_counts': {
      'test1': {
        'PASS_COUNT': int,
        'FAIL_COUNT': int,
      },
      ...
    },
    'findit_notrun': set(),
  }
"""


def result_format(
    valid=False, failures=None, total_tests_ran=0,
    pass_fail_counts=None, findit_notrun=None):
  """Returns a dict in the canonical format with all required keys.

  All of the arguments below will be present in the returned dict, whether
  they were explicitly passed as arguments or not.

  Args:
    valid: A boolean indicating whether the test run was valid.
    failures: An iterable of strings, where each string is the name of a test
      that failed.
    total_tests_ran: An integer number of tests that were run.
    pass_fail_counts: A dictionary that maps test names to pass and fail counts,
      e.g.
        {
          'test3': { 'PASS_COUNT': 3, 'FAIL_COUNT': 2 }
        }
    findit_notrun: A temporary field for FindIt. Lists tests for which every
      test run had result NOTRUN or UNKNOWN.
