    test_binary (TestBinary): The test binary with preset settings using with_*
      methods.
    strategy (str): The strategy name that generating the step.
    reproducing_rate (float): Reproducing rate by running the given test binary.
      This is different from failure rate, as failed runs / total runs. A test
      binary could rerun the test multiple times and only need to fail once to
      be counted as reproduced.
    duration (int): Duration in milliseconds of the total running time of the
      given test binary. It should contain all the repeats included in test
      binary options.
    reproduced_cnt (int): Number of times the failure reproduced during
      verification.
    total_run_cnt (int): Number of run times during verification.
